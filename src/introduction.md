# Introduction

When evaluating AI capabilities across different domains, benchmarking provides crucial insights into performance strengths and weaknesses. These benchmarks cover a range of tasks, focusing on coding, writing, and proofreading. Below is a comparative table summarizing these benchmarks, including specific use cases:

| Use Case                                           | Category       | Key Metrics                                         | Common Challenges                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Coding with large context                          | Coding         | Syntax accuracy, logic correctness, handling context  | Edge cases, optimization, managing dependencies    |
| Debugging                                          | Coding         | Logic correctness, error identification             | Complex codebases, tricky bugs                     |
| Boilerplate generation                             | Coding         | Syntax accuracy, efficiency                         | Code style consistency, framework compatibility    |
| Fixing diagnostic issues                           | Coding         | Error identification, code correction               | Understanding error messages, complex dependencies |
| Coding with existing codebase/starter project      | Coding         | Code integration, understanding existing code       | Code style consistency, dependency management      |
| Content creation                                   | Writing        | Coherence, originality, tone                        | Consistency, factual accuracy                      |
| Summarizing or reviewing multiple articles         | Writing        | Summarization accuracy, review depth                | Handling large amounts of information, consistency |
| Summarizing one article                            | Writing        | Summarization accuracy, key point identification    | Identifying most important information             |
| Grammar checking for English                       | Proofreading   | Error detection, grammar fixes                      | Idiomatic expressions, complex sentence structures |
| Proofreading for Chinese                          | Proofreading   | Error detection, grammar fixes, contextual nuance | Character nuances, idiomatic expressions           |

These benchmarks are based on my personal use cases, with a strong focus on coding tasks. They are not intended to represent a comprehensive evaluation of all possible AI capabilities across these domains. While they reveal trade-offs, it's important to remember this is from a specific, coding-centric perspective. Performance across these categories may correlate with model architecture and training data breadth. These benchmarks can be used with various testing frameworks, such as MCP, Aider, and Zed.
